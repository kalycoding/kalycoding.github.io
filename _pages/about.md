I am an accomplished software engineer with a strong track record of developing innovative solutions and improving system efficiencies. Currently, I serve as the Founding Software Engineer at Knowtex.ai (YC 22), where I have played a pivotal role in several key projects:

  * Integrated two Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with Knowtex appointment systems, significantly enhancing patient scheduling efficiency.

  * Implemented a serverless architecture on AWS using Lambda, SQS, API Gateway, RDS, and DynamoDB, improving scalability and cost-effectiveness.

  * Oversaw the refinement and deployment of Knowtex priority LLM models on AWS, boosting model efficacy and response speed while reducing costs.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Athelas, where I achieved notable successes:

  * Created backend services using Python and Cloud Functions.

  * Successfully integrated over five EHR systems end-to-end, contributing to an annual revenue increase of more than $10 million.

  * Designed and implemented an internal monitoring tool for EHR integrations, which has been widely adopted within the company, significantly streamlining the monitoring process and improving efficiency and reliability.

In addition to my professional achievements, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and mentoring others. I volunteer as a mentor at Arewa Data Science Academy, where I teach Deep Learning. I am always open to learning and collaborating on exciting new projects.
